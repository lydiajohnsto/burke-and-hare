<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>The mid-18th to mid-19th century was a time of increasingly changing social dynamics throughout Scotland. Starting from after the Jacobite Rebellion of the 
  18th century, Scotland was put under the tight grip of the British Crown. Strong influence from English culture and money from English aristocrats flooded the 
  Lowland cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, turning them into important manufacturing cities during the Industrial Revolution. The (at the time) recent invention 
  of the train further connected the Lowlands of Scotland to England in the south. Lowlanders adopted more English customs and power structures, and spoke the 
  English dialect Scots in much higher numbers as opposed to Scottish Gaelic. The mountainous, highly agrarian Scottish Highlands, and the Highlanders inhabiting 
  them, were under less influence and less control by the English crown than their Lowland counterparts. These people continued to abide by their clan system, 
  retaining much of their culture. They also continued to speak Scottish Gaelic in high numbers. After the Jacobite Rebellion, however, the Highlands were seen as 
  an area that needed to be more highly controlled, and the clan system as well as cultural customs were severely weakened and limited by the Crown.  

From the late 18th to the early/mid-19th century, both Highland and Lowland Scots settled into their new identity as uniquely Scottish but also British crown 
  subjects. Scotland grew to be an economic and political powerhouse, as aspects of Scottish culture made Scots more emboldened to take a chance and reap success 
  from these risks. Scotland was not merely the other kingdom on the island of Britain anymore, but an equally important economic and cultural center of the 
  British nation. Edinburgh became a center for medical education, with the well-regarded Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh churning out well trained 
  English, Scottish, and Welsh physicians. The Tartan and kilt had been banned or heavily restricted since the Jacobites, because they symbolized Scottish 
  nationalism and the people who took up arms against the Crown. In the early 1800s, the kilt and Tartan pattern were co-opted by the Lowland aristocracy and
  even English royalty and socialites as a symbol of the unique Scottish-British culture that had evolved.   

Scotland grew from the agrarian and rural little brother of England to a rival highly urban economic powerhouse relatively quickly, and this meteoric rise to
  prominence shaped Scottish culture into a unique identity that may have seemed very foreign to their ancestors just a hundred or so years prior. The noticeable 
  Highland-Lowland divide was slowly mended, but both groups still keep parts of their respective unique identities outside of being a Scotsman or a Brit.  </h2>
