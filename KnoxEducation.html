<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h3>While at the Royal High School, Dr. Knox was a gold medalist and in his final year, the top pupil in his school. In 1810 when he went on to study medicine at 
  the University of Edinburgh, he studied anatomy under the respected anatomist Dr. John Barclay. Dr. John Barclay is said to have considered Dr. Knox as his most 
  brilliant student. He graduated with his MD from the University of Edinburgh in 1814. In 1815 while serving in Waterloo, he learned surgery fast as there was 
  only one surgeon and one assistant per regiment. During this time, he also gained experience with dissection. In October of 18121, Dr. Knox went to France where 
  he studied anatomy under the French naturalists Georges Cuvier and Ã‰tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.</h3>
