<h1><center>Welcome.</center></h1>
<p>&nbsp</p>
<p>This website will take you on a journey through 19th century Scotland. It will visit graveyards and amphitheaters, murderers and doctors.</p>
<p>This is a period of history where the relationship between England and Scotland was changing, when fears of the consequences of scientific 
  advancement were at a high, and when cities were stigmatized as places of sin and violence.</p>
<p>Through this medium, we hope to give a wider view of the many facets of life which influenced this infamous case.</p>
<p>Explore webpages and follow the breadcrumb trail that will allow you to string together what happened in Edinburgh, 1828. This game 
  is open-ended and based upon concepts of exploration and discovery. There is no set ending.</p>
