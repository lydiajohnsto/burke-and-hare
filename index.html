<p>This website will take you on a journey through 19th century Scotland. It will visit graveyards and amphitheaters, murderers and doctors.</p>
<p>This is a period of history where the relationship between England and Scotland was changing, when fears of the consequences of scientific 
  advancement were at a high, and when cities were stigmatized as places of sin and violence.</p>
