<p>There is not much known about William Hare before the murders took place but, according to Rosner in The Anatomy Murders is that he came from County Armagh and 
  potentially from the parish of Newry in Ireland but don’t know what brought him to Scotland. We do know that they had been in Scotland for around 10 years and 
  Burke and Hare met in Edinburgh around the 1820s working on the Union Canal.

When the trial started Hare turned King’s Evidence meaning that he exposed his partner in the crime William Burke and his wife Helen M’Dougal over to the law. 
  This led to Burke being found guilty and hanged while his wife and their child left for Belfast. All proceedings against Hare failed and he was released in 
  February of 1829. There is not much know about what happened to him after a trial. We know he was put on a coach to Dumfries and wanted to board a boat to 
  Ireland but was denied. He found refuge in the jail and then after leaving his things the police lead him on a road to England. It is suspected he made it 
  back to Ireland as his sister return to Dumfries and picked up what he had left.

There are some accounts of what could have happened, one being that he ended up as a blind beggar in Ireland, the other came from a contemporary newspaper account 
  about 7 weeks after he was released from jail. In summary it states that hare called into a public house in Scarva with his wife and child. After getting a drink 
  he was recognized and kicked out. He was followed by a group of boys heading towards Loughbrickland while his wife begged for forgiveness and implored that she 
  had nothing to do with his crimes. It states that he was now residing with his family at an uncle’s house. Interestingly the paper also states and before he left 
  for Scotland, he was living in the service of a Mr. Hall who was a keeper of the eleventh lock and was engaged in driving the horses working on the Newry Canal. 
  He was known as being of ferocious and malignant disposition and actually killed one of his masters’ horses which is why he fled to

Scotland. This account is not one that was published in the newspaper (The Northern Whig). There are many other possibilities for what could have happened to him 
  after the fact and Rosner shares some in her novel, all we know is that there is not much known about William Hare before and after the murders.</p>
