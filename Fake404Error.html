<h3>Vivisection is surgery (dissection) conducted for experimental purposes. They are typically performed on living organisms, and in the case of Hare and Burke 
  and with the help of Dr. Knox performed on humans. The goal of vivisection is to view the internal structure of living things. Vivisection in earlier times was 
  used as a form of torture. In the 1820s in Scotland, vivisection was considered business on the black-market business, where people were killed and bodies dug 
  up in the name of science. Simultaneously, the laws and regulations of vivisection on humans in the form of science were being regulated. Medicine was starting 
  to go through a transformation. Hospitals and more advanced tools like the stethoscope, along with a mass of other developments, were causing medicinal practices
  to boom. Along with this, the advancement of policies regarding human life and medical practices needed to be improved. At the time, the main victims who were
  killed were not protected by Scottish law at the time. These were mainly those who died in prison, suicide victims, and the bodies of foundlings and orphans. 
  With the rise in hospitals, there was also a rise in the prestigiousness of medical training. However, there was a lack of bodies for the study of this medicine.
  This, in turn, caused a rise in students, lecturers, and graver robbers (resurrection men) and began the black market of exhumed cadavers. During the 19th 
  century the debate around vivisection was characterized as whether the suffering of animals and their rights or interest were less important than the effects of 
  vivisection on the experimenter’s morals and reputation. It is argued that the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act focus on the wantonness or deliberateness of 
  vivisection encourages experimenters to justify their actions because of the perceived medical benefits of vivisection. On the other side, many physicians were 
  concerned that the links between medicine and vivisection would deter patients from seeking help. In the nineteenth century there was a growing worry and fear 
  around doctors and medical professionals, much of the fear was coming from women who would regularly be sent to doctor for hysteria or other demeaning 
  “illnesses”. With the rise of vivisection and other bloody medical studies and the Burke and Hare case involving Dr. Robert Knox many people grew to despise 
  vivisection for its more murderous and painful techniques. One infamous medical professional who was seen by many as a monster was François Magendie as well 
  as his disciple Claude Bernard. Bernard believed that only properly controlled and rigorous animal experiments could provide reliable information about 
  physiology and pathology. He also believed in the importance of ideas and theories to create hypothesis and proper safeguarding but that they were only useful 
  if they were backed by a substantial amount of experimentation. At the beginning of the Victorian era there was no regulation for animal experimentation but 
  many prominent figures, especially in British society were against these types of experiments. Because of the revelation of the horrors of medical practices 
  at the time many started to criticize those like Magendie and Bernard. Magendie became the forefront of this anti-vivisectionist movement and was described as 
  “an exceptionally cruel person who submitted animals to needless torture.” His public presentations of his experiments soon became notorious with the discovery 
  of one where he was dissecting a dogs facial nerves while the dog was nailed down by each paw and was left like that overnight until a continuation of the 
  dissection until the next day. One of his experiments was recorded by an American physician where it states, “Monsieur M. has not only lost all feeling for the 
  victims he tortures, but he really likes his business. When the animal squeaks a little, the operator grins; when loud screams are uttered, he sometimes laughs 
  outright.” When things like this become public you can only imagine the public’s reaction to this horror. Now we must understand that the use of anesthetics was 
  not available at this time, but, the nailing of animals down while preforming on them live while they are clearly experiencing pain was not necessary. Bernard 
  would go on to carry out his experiments where he would cut open conscious animals while slowly cooking them alive to study thermoregulation. Both Magendie and 
  Bernard where against the study and vivisection of humans without the use of substantial experimentation on animals. They did not hold animals at the same regard 
  as humans and found testing on humans to be immoral. In an Article from 1885 in The North American Review by Noah K. Davis he states that in medical journals 
  like The Lancet that, “…we find that painful experiments are not at all infrequent. The opponents of the practice collect the telling cases, and describe them 
  as sawing across the backbone, dissecting and irritating the great nerves, driving catheters along the veins and arteries, inoculating with dreadful diseases, 
  cutting out parts of the intestines, stewing and baking in a stove, pouring boiling water into the stomach, boiling or freezing to death, and by mechanical 
  processes reducing the brain to the condition of ‘a newly plowed potato-field’.” So it is no wonder that with this knowledge out there for the public that cases 
  like that of Birke and Hare become infamous for its time. </h3>
