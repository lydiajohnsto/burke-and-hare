<p>William Burke was born in 1792 in the town of Urney, County Tyrone, (what is now Northern) Ireland. His exact day and month of birth is unknown, but he is said to have been born in the springtime. Burke grew up 
  fairly comfortably in an Irish Catholic household and was known as a fairly intelligent boy growing up. He tried his hand as a baker and then as a weaver in his early teen life but did not stick around those 
  trades long. Following his brother, Burke joined the British Army through the Donegal Militia as a teen, serving seven years with his regiment and eventually marrying a now unknown woman from County Mayo during 
  his service. After leaving the Army, Burke served as a personal valet for three or so years, before eventually having a falling out with his faither-in-law over a property dispute. Burke in 1818 left behind his
  wife and close family in Ireland, moving to Scotland and becoming a laborer who worked on the Union Canal. While working on the canal, Burke eventually met a woman by the name of Helen McDougal. The two would 
  settle down outside Edinburgh in 1827 after Burkeâ€™s work on the canal was finished, the two becoming hawkers and Burke evidently starting work as a cobbler. On the road to visit to Glasgow in 1827, Burke and 
  McDougal met Hare and his wife, who convinced them to visit their Inn in Edinburgh, starting the series of events that led to the execution of William Burke.  </p>
