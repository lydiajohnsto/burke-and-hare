<h3>The trial began November 2nd, 1828

The Pannel found William Burke guilty of one murder and sentenced him to execution by hanging in which afterwards his body would be publicly dissected, anatomized and his skeleton preserved. He was executed on January 28, 1829. His wife, Helen McDougal, was found not proven and she was sent out with the hope that she would change her way of life for the better.

William Hare and his wife Margaret Laird provided Kings Evidence to the court. Meaning that if they gave up information about William Burke, Heather McDougal, and their crimes, they would be acquitted of any charges. William hare left Edinburgh after the trials.

Dr. Knox was cleared of any trial or involvement with Burke and Hare. However, his reputation in Edinburgh was heavily damaged and the Royal College of Surgeons pressed him to resign from his role as museum curator.</h3>
