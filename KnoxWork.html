<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h3>In 1822, Dr. Knox was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh and worked to establish a Museum of Comparative Anatomy for the Royal College of Surgeons. 
  After Dr. Barclay’s death in 1826, Knox became principal of Barclay’s Anatomy School in Surgeons Square. Enrollment went up in the school due to Knox’s 
  expertise and abilities as a teacher, in the academic year 1827-28, Knox had a little above 500 students enrolled in his extramural anatomy class. Dr. Knox is 
  said to have been a caring teacher who often invited students over for dinner and checked in when they were ill. His classes were so popular because he promised 
  the students that they would see the human body fully dissected, which of course required him to somehow acquire the necessary subjects. That is how he became 
  involved with William Burke and William Hare, ultimately leading to his fall from teaching grace.</h3>
